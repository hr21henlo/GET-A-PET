# GET-A-PET
This is my first ever attempt at a website(welll...more lika a frontpage, not a fully working site yet.) .  ACtually,it's not even the first, i've made 2 others before, but never posted them because I was still figuring out how to use github.

The project is called" GET A PET", amd it's built purely on HTML & CSS . With lots of help from YT tutorials and ...( The design part was actually done by my friend, who's a graphic designer.)
