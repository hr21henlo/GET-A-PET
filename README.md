# GET-A-PET
This is my very first attempt at creating a website—or more accurately, a front
page prototype rather than a fully functional site just yet. Technically, it’s
not my first-ever project; I’ve built two earlier versions while I was still
exploring and learning how to use GitHub, but I never published them.

The project is called “GET A PET” , and it’s built entirely with HTML & CSS.
I leaned heavily on YouTube tutorials for guidance, and the design elements
were brought to life with the help of a friend who’s a graphic designer.
